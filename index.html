								<div class="test">
				
				<p> I am currently a Staff Scientist at Las Cumbres Observatory. My research interests primarily revolve around observational studies of exoplanets. </p>
				<p> I grew up in the Jemez Mountains of Northern New Mexico. I obtained my B.A. in astronomy and physics from Wesleyan University in 2011, having spent a semester abroad at the University of St. Andrews, Scotland. I attended graduate school in astronomy at the University of Texas at Austin; I obtained my M.A. in 2013 and my Ph.D. in 2016, both under the supervision of Prof. William Cochran. After that I spent three years as the Columbus Prize Postdoctoral Fellow at the Ohio State University (and later led a successful campaign to rename the fellowship, due to Columbus' general misdeeds).</p>
				<p> Outside of academia I enjoy hiking and jogging (and generally being outdoors), reading, and board games. As if all the above wasn't enough to keep me busy, I am also an aspiring science fiction/fantasy writer (nothing published yet, but stay tuned...)</p>
				<p> My family has a long history in the STEM fields. My grandfather, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Goad">Walter Goad</a>, co-founded GenBank, one of the world's first nucleotide sequence databases; my grandmother, Maxine Goad, authored the first state-level groundwater quality rules in the nation and devoted her career to protecting groundwater; and my great-grandfather, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Steineke">Max Steineke</a>, was principally responsible for the discovery of oil in Saudi Arabia. </p>

				<p> My research interests include: the use of Doppler tomography (aka Doppler imaging) to address problems in planetary and stellar astrophysics; the discovery and characterization of exoplanetary systems; and the effects of interstellar and interplanetary environments upon planetary climate and habitability. My focus is primarily observational, and I have experience working with high-resolution spectroscopy, and photometry from both space-based and ground-based facilities. </p>
				<h2>Current Research</h2>
				<h4>Doppler Tomography</h4>
				<p> My major research direction centers around the use of the technique of <i>Doppler tomography</i>. I will provide a brief introduction to the technique here, but please see <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...790...30J">my paper</a> on Kepler-13 Ab for a more technical description. </p>

<p> Doppler tomography relies upon the fact that all stars rotate to some degree. One hemisphere of the star will be rotating towards the observer, and so the light from that hemisphere will be blueshifted, whereas the other will be rotating away, and so its light will be redshifted. Each surface element of the star will contribute to the overall spectrum of the star, but its contribution will be Doppler shifted due to the rotation. Thus, the star's spectral lines will exhibit <i>rotational broadening</i>-the star's spectral lines will be wider than one might naively expect.</p>

<p> Now, what happens if a planet transits across the star? It will block regions of the stellar disk with a small range of radial velocities, causing a smaller contribution to the line profile at these velocities and perturbing the line shape-this manifests as a "bump" in the line profile. This is known as the <i>Rossiter-McLaughlin Effect</i>. As the planet moves across the stellar disk during the transit, the bump moves across the line profile in a corresponding manner. As can be seen in the animations below, the manner in which this line profile perturbation moves depends upon the angle between the stellar spin axis and the planetary orbital plane (as projected on the plane of the sky), known as the <i>spin-orbit misalignment</i> and typically denoted &#955. Detection of this effect for a transiting planet candidate allows me to validate the candidate as an actual planet, rather than an astrophysical false positive such as a background eclipsing binary blended with a brighter foreground star, as it shows that the transiting object orbits the target star. Radial velocity observations are also required to exclude the possibility that the transiting object is actually a late M dwarf or a brown dwarf rather than a planet; this can be accomplished with a radial velocity precision of only about 1 km/s. One major focus of my Doppler tomography research is to confirm transiting planet candidates around rapidly rotating stars. Doppler tomography is most effective for stars with vsini > 20 km/s, but very high resolution spectrographs (R > 100,000) allow the detection of the line profile perturbation even for stars rotating as slowly as ~3 km/s (<a href="http://mnras.oxfordjournals.org/content/403/1/151">Collier Cameron et al. 2010</a>).</p>

<p> Left to right: Doppler tomographic transit signatures of a planet on a prograde orbit, a retrograde orbit, and a polar orbit. Note the qualitative differences in the motions of the transit signatures during the transit.</p> 

<p> The spin-orbit misalignment is important in part because it is a probe of planetary migration processes. This parameter has been measured for many hot Jupiters and a few smaller and longer-period planets, a significant number of which have highly inclined orbits. <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2041-8205/718/2/L145/meta">Winn et al. (2010)</a> showed that hot Jupiters with highly misaligned orbits preferentially orbit stars with Teff > 6250 K. Since then a great deal of theoretical effort has been invested in explaining the origins of these misalignments, but to date observational constraints have lagged behind the theory. Thus, a major effort of my research is to use Doppler tomographic measurements of spin-orbit misalignments (particularly for planets orbiting hot stars, and warm Jupiters) to distinguish among the different misalignment mechanisms.</p>

<p>To date I have published Doppler tomographic spin-orbit misalignment measurements for six planets, and contributed to such measurements for three others. You can see animations of all of these systems on the Doppler Tomography Gallery page of this site.</p>





<h4>Exoplanet Detection</h4>
				<p> I am also interested in the discovery of new exoplanets, in particular transiting planets. I am a member of three planet search collaborations: KELT, KESPRINT, and the McDonald Observatory Planet Search.</p>
				<p>I am a member of the <a href="http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/keltnorth/Home.html">KELT</a> planet search team, where I have put my Doppler tomographic expertise to good use; KELT observes brighter stars than most other ground-based transiting planet searches, and as a result has a higher proportion of hot stars which are amenable to Doppler tomography. I lead our discovery of <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AJ....155..100J">KELT-21 b</a>, a hot Jupiter transiting the most rapidly rotating star known to host such a planet. I also contributed to our discoveries of <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017Natur.546..514G">KELT-9 b</a>, <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AJ....155...35S">KELT-19 Ab</a>, <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017AJ....154..194L">KELT-20 b</a>, and <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018arXiv180307559L">KELT-22 Ab</a>.</p>
				<p>I am a member of the KESPRINT collaboration to find and confirm transiting planets with <i>Kepler's</i> K2 extended mission, and the upcoming <i>TESS</i> mission. I lead <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/0004-6256/151/6/171/meta">our paper</a> announcing the discovery of the hot Jupiters K2-29 b and K2-30 b, and a new hot Jupiter and warm Saturn (Johnson et al., submitted). I have also assisted with our observations and analysis on several other transiting planets: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00239">K2-99 b</a>, <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017AJ....154..123G">HD 3167 b and c</a>, <a href=" http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017AJ....154..226D">K2-131 b</a>, and <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?arXiv:1711.02097">K2-141 b</a>.</p>
				<p> I am also a member of the McDonald Observatory Planet Search group, an ongoing radial velocity survey using the 2.7 m Harlan J. Smith Telescope at McDonald Observatory. During my time in graduate school I logged nearly 70 nights observing for this program. I lead <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/0004-637X/821/2/74">our paper</a> analyzing our data on the nearby planet host star HD 219134, where we identified a 11.7-year stellar activity cycle, and also found a stellar activity signature due to rotation at a period of 22.8 days, suggesting that the previously claimed planet HD 219134 f at that period may be a false positive due to activity. I also contributed to <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/0004-637X/818/1/34/meta">our discovery</a> of Jupiter analogs around &#968<sup>1</sup> Dra B and HD 95872, and <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AJ....155..159B">our mass measurement</a> of the directly-imaged brown dwarf Gl 758 B.</p>

				

				<h2>Past Research</h2>
				<h4>Interstellar Medium</h4>
				<p> In this project I constructed the first three-dimensional map of interstellar medium clouds within the <i>Kepler</i> prime mission search volume. The Kepler mission searched for extrasolar planets using the transit method in a field of view located in the constellations Lyra and Cygnus. The interstellar environment can have consequences for the climate of planets, and so I placed preliminary constraints on these parameters for nearby <i>Kepler</i> planets. I conducted this work in collaboration with Prof. Seth Redfield (Wesleyan University) and Prof. Adam Jensen (University of Nebraska-Kearney). See <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03454v1">my paper</a>. </p>
				<h4>Exoplanet Transit Timing</h4>
				<p> During the spring of 2009 and from summer 2010 until May 2011 I worked with Prof. Seth Redfield (Wesleyan University) on the Wesleyan Transiting Exoplanet Program (WesTEP), a project to utilize the 0.6-m (24-in) Perkin Telescope at Wesleyan University's Van Vleck Observatory to observe the transits of known transiting exoplanets, and refine their parameters. I focused on searches for and analysis of transit timing variations (TTVs). </p>
				<h4>Circumstellar Envelopes</h4>
				<p> In the summer of 2009 I participated in the REU program at MIT Haystack Observatory. I worked with Dr. Lynn Matthews to reduce and analyze Very Large Array and Green Bank Telescope H I 21-cm line data of the circumstellar envelopes of asymptotic giant branch stars. I worked with data on <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011AJ....141...60M">X Herculis</a>, <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013AJ....145...97M">R Pegasi, and Y Ursae Majoris</a>.</p>
				<h4>The Milky Way's Thick Disk</h4>
				<p> My first research experience came through the Keck Northeast Astronomy Consortium REU, where I spent the summer of 2008 at Vassar College working with Dr. Allyson Sheffield on a project to search for kinematic and chemical substructures or gradients within the Milky Way's thick disk. See <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...761..161S">our paper</a>.</p>

				<h3 class="title">The Astronomer's Oath</h3>
				<p> (A parody of the Oath of the Night's Watch from George R. R. Martin's <i>A Song of Ice and Fire</i> novels)</p>
				<p> <i>Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until the observing run is over. I shall make no light, miss no targets, lose no data. I shall fear no clouds and expect no citations. I shall live and sleep on the mountain. I am the geek in the darkness. I am the watcher in the dome. I am the gloves that gird against the cold, the monitor that shows my data, the telescope that pierces the darkness, the mind that ranges the realms of science. I pledge my life and honor to astronomy, for this night and all nights to come.</i> </p>
				<h3 class="title">Writing</h3>
				<p>During my final year in grad school I served as a volunteer for McDonald Observatory's <a href="https://askanastronomer.org/">Ask an Astronomer</a> website, answering questions from the public with short essay answers. I answered these questions:</p>
				<p><a href="https://askanastronomer.org/planets/2016/02/02/comets-orbit/"><i>Why do comets not get captured by Earth’s gravity during a close flyby?</i></a></p>
				<p><a href="https://askanastronomer.org/planets/2015/10/07/the-orbit-of-nibiru/"><i>Can a hypothetical Planet X whip around from behind the Sun in a 3600-years orbit?</i></a></p>
				<p>I blogged during my semester abroad in Scotland, Spring 2010 at <a href="http://www.firthofchile.blogspot.com/">Craving Chile by the Firth of Forth*</a></p>
				<h3 class="title">Media Appearances</h3>
